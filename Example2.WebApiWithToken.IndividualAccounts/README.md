# Example2.WebApiWithToken.IndividualAccounts

This project contains a example of using the AuthPermissions.AspNetCore library in ASP.NET Core web api where the authentication/authorization is held in a JWT token. This example shows how the AuthPermissions.AspNetCore library can work with JWT tokens and provide a way improve security.

This article (!!! LINK !!!) details how this example was built, and how it works.

- **Application**: ASP.NET Core web API
- **AuthorizationProvider**: ASP.NET Core's individual accounts
- **CookieOrToken**: JWT Token
- **MultiTenant**: not used
- **Databases**: One SQL Server database uses by two parts
  - Individual accounts
  - AuthPermissions.
- **Focused on**: The basics of the AuthPermissions authorization system.
- **Special features**: JWT Token with refresh feature.

The ASP.NET Core project was created via Create new project > ASP.NET Core Web API with no Authentication. Then I added:

1. Startup.ConfigureServices method:
   1. Added Individual Accounts, e.g. add `AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>...`
   2. Added JWT authentication, e.g. add `services.AddAuthentication(auth => ... JWTBearer`
   3. Added RegisterAuthPermissions, e.g. add `services.RegisterAuthPermissions<YourPermissionEnum>...` etc.
   4. Updated the Swagger code to allow the JWT Token can be added to the Swagger Authorize button.
2. Startup.Configure method:
   1. Added `app.UseAuthentication();`
3. appsettings.json file: Setup data for the JWT Token - see JwtData section.
4. Created a `AuthenticateController` which provided Web API methods that let a user log in and obtain a JWT Token (and optional a Refresh Token) to use in normal accesses to the other Web APIs.
5. Added a `[HasPermission(Example2Permissions.Permission1)]` attribute to the GET method in the `WeatherForecastController`, so that if the user didn't have `Permission1` the request will return an error.

### The Example2.WebApiWithToken.IndividualAccounts code/features used in this example

- A Web API to log in which returns a JWT Token
- A Web API to log in which returns a JWT Token and Refresh Token, with another Web API to refresh the JWT Token without the user from having to log in again.
- A simple .
