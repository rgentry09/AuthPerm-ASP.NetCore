# Explaining AuthP's AuthUser

If you create an ASP.NET Core application that people have to log into ASP.NET Core you will use a ASP.NET Core _authentication provider_ (see [ASP.NET Core docs on authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/)). The authentication provider's job is to check that the user that is logging in is valid, e.g. it is known to the authentication provider and they provided the correct secret information. Some authentication providers, like ASP.NET Coreâ€™s Individual Accounts authentication provider, stores the user's information in a database linked to your application, but many authentication provider, such as Azure active directory or Google, store the information externally.

But for the AuthP library we need extra data not available from the authentication provider - this is where AuthP's `AuthUser` comes in.

## AuthP's `AuthUser` entity

AuthP's `AuthUser` entity is linked logged-in user via the authentication provider _user id_. The `AuthUser` entity holds the extra data needed to make AuthP work: They are:

- The [AuthP's Roles](https://github.com/JonPSmith/AuthPermissions.AspNetCore/blob/main/docs/concepts/roles.md) for a user.
- Optional [AuthP's multi-tenant option](!!!!) information.

### Keeping the AuthP's AuthUsers in sync with the authentication provider's users

The authentication provider's users are the master list of users, and when authentication provider's users are added or removed we need to update the AuthP's AuthUsers. This is covered by the [sync](!!!!) feature in the AuthP's [AuthUser's admin service](!!!!). This sync feature tells you if the `AuthUser` entities are out of date  and provides feature to fix any changes so that the AuthUsers match the authentication provider's user info.

_NOTE: In addition the [AuthUser's admin service](!!!!) allows you alter an AuthUser's AuthP's Roles and multi-tenant information._

## How are the AuthP claims added to the logging-in user?

When a user logs in the AuthP will automatically add extra claims to a Cookie Authentication (if configured, or if you are using JWT Token Authentication you call a method to build the JWT Token which includes the AuthP's claims.

The diagram below shows how the AuthUser's Roles are turned into a combined list of Permissions and then turned in to a claim in the Cookie or JWT Token.

## How are the AuthP claims used once a user is logged in?

Then on every HTTP request ASP.NET Core will automatically all the claims from the Cookie Authentication or JWT Token and builds a `ClaimsPrincipal`, which is in the HTTP context under the property `User`. The diagram below shows this in action.
